# Composer WP

I'm a nerd.  I like nerdy things.  Like dependency management and WordPress.
This is the way that I set up and maintain [dashifen.com](https://dashifen.com).
It utilizes the [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) dependency manager to 
maintain not only some of my own plugins and themes but also WordPress core
and WP plugins installed via the (wpackagist)[https://wpackagist.org] mirror 
WordPress.org plugin repository.
